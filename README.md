Inverted colour grid

This project was inspired by the colour lessons in CodeAcademy CSS lessons. I wanted to practice using hsl so made a grid of coloured divs, which turn into their inverted colour (+/- 180 degrees on the colour wheel) whenever you hover over them. I like to think it's a sort of simple version of those animated mouse paths you get on more complex websites.
